## 📌 Project Overview
This project is an AI-driven data analytics platform built using Python and Streamlit.
It allows users to upload any CSV file and automatically performs data analysis,
machine learning, and interactive visualization through a simple dashboard.

The application demonstrates an end-to-end analytics workflow, including
data ingestion, data cleaning, transformation, modeling, and insight generation.

## 🎯 Project Objectives
The key objectives of this project are to:
- Analyze CSV datasets easily without manual coding
- Automatically apply machine learning models
- Visualize insights through an interactive dashboard
- Demonstrate an end-to-end data analytics and ML workflow

---

## 🚀 Key Features
- Upload any CSV file
- Automatic detection of numeric columns
- Target column selection for prediction
- Automatic machine learning model training
- KPI metrics display
- Interactive charts and plots
- Model performance evaluation
- Executive summary generation
- Live deployment on Streamlit Cloud

---

## 🧠 Machine Learning Details
- Model Used: Random Forest Regressor  
- Task: Regression  

Evaluation Metrics:
- Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
- R² Score  

The model is trained automatically after the user selects the target numeric column.

---

## 📊 Visualizations Included
- KPI Cards (Total Value, Average Value, Best Value, Data Count)
- Performance Trend Chart
- Actual vs Predicted Scatter Plot
- Target Distribution Histogram
- Residual Error Analysis Plot

---

## 🔄 ETL-Style Workflow
- Extract: User-uploaded CSV data  
- Transform: Data cleaning, preprocessing, and feature selection  
- Load: Processed data used for analytics, visualization, and modeling
